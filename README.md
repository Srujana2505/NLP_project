## Event Extraction from Disaster Tweets
This project aims to extract events related to disasters from Twitter data. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and extract relevant information from disaster-related tweets.

**Data Collection**
- The first step is to collect disaster-related tweets. There are several ways to collect Twitter data, such as using the Twitter API or downloading pre-existing datasets. For this project, we will be using a pre-existing dataset of disaster-related tweets.

**Preprocessing**
- Once we have collected the tweets, we need to preprocess them. Preprocessing involves cleaning the text, removing stop words, and tokenizing. Manual pre-processing is done for this project.

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- The next step is to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the preprocessed text. NER involves identifying named entities such as location, person, organization, date, and time from the text.

**Event Extraction**
- We can use different techniques to get the events. The one we used in this project is DBSCAN. This is a clustering algorithm and this groups the data into different clusters.
